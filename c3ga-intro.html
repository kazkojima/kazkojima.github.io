<h2>Conformal model of 3D space</h2>
<p><img src="./images/dorst-1-1.png" alt="figure 1.1 of book" width="640">
(Fig.1.1 of the book)</p>
<p>The conformal model is an ample model of the 3D space. Points, lines, planes, circles, spheres and many known geometrical constructions can be represented with algebraic ways in that model.</p>
<p>There are 2 additional bases of this representation space. One is o which represents "origin" and the other one is ∞ which means "infinity". For readability, write "no" for o and "ni" for ∞. The 3D point (x, y, z) can be represented as the 5D point no + x e1 + y e2 + z e3 + 0.5 α ni where α = x x + y y + z z and e1-3 are "euclidean" bases.</p>
<p>It looks very strange and somewhat artificial but turns out to be a surprisingly fine embedding. It's also a good extension of homogeneous model.
In this world, we have the unit "psudoscalar" I = no^e1^e2^e3^ni which behaves like a "complete" element where ^ is the outer(wedge) product.  With it, a bit unpopular construction "dual" of A can be defined to be A/I and denoded by A*.</p>
<p>When p,q,r,s are 4 3D points with a general position represented in this model space, S = p^q^r^s represents a sphere on which those 4 points are. It's known that S* = c - 0.5 rho rho ni where c is the center of S and rho is the radius of S. Looks things go well, don't they?</p>
<p>Rotation, translation and another "conformal" transformation can be described with the uniform manner -- "versor" in this model. They give not only theoritical but also computational tools in the real applications. I hear that the Unreal Engin uses the conformal model and the geometric algebra in their lighting computations.</p>
<h3>Plunge</h3>
<p>There are intresting constructions which are a bit unpopular.
"Plunge" is one of them. An example of plunge is here.</p>
<p><img src="./images/plunge-1.png" alt="plunge" width="640"></p>
<p>The circle labeled p ^ K* is the plunge of p, S and H. It crosses perpendicularly to the point p, the sphere S and the plane H.</p>
<p>A circle of latitude can be considered as another example of plunge.</p>
<p><img src="./images/latitude.png" alt="plunge" width="640"></p>
<p>If you live in point p on this sphere surface not poles, then p ^ L* is the circle of latitude passes p where L is the earth's axis. Since L can be a meet of two planes H and H', p ^ L* = p ^ H* ^ H'* which is the plunge of p, H and H'.</p>
<p><img src="./images/dorst-15-5.png" alt="plunge" width="640"></p>
<p>This is Fig.15.5 of the book which shows many circles p ^ L* for various points p. Now L* looks like the field of possible circles, doesn't it?</p>
