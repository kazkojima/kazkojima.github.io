My ESP-WROOM-32 board has 2 spi slave devices MPU-9250 and MS5611. I've troubled with DMA on spi. It looks `issue 598 <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/598>`_ which happens when DMA is used on half-duplex mode and the command/address phases are disabled.
I've looked into spi driver sources.
